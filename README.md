## About

>The social music platform of the future!

This is our final project for Ironhack Berlin's July-October 2018 Full-Stack Web Development bootcamp!

It represents the culmination of our 9 weeks and also specifically our React module. 

The idea is simple: twitter meets spotify. Share the music you are listening to right now, with a simple comment. 
>Follow people who like similar music, follow your friends, make new friends!
